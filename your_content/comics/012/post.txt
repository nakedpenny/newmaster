<h2>Author's Notes</h2>

Some hewani treat the Phoenix as a scary story to make their kits do their chores. Others view the fabled Child of Fire with revulsion, preferring to omit her from the story entirely. Still others fear her, believing her to be a very real entity who must be extinguished. There have been occasional claims of sightings over the last 100 years, though many doubt that such a creature, even if she did exist at one time, could still be alive after so long, let alone after living in the wildlands so far away from civilization.

(And that's it for the Prologue! We hope you enjoyed this dive into the lore of Mothorial. Now, onward to your regular scheduled programming featuring a Bird and a Bat!)
