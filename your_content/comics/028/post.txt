<h2>Author's Notes</h2>

Cori's fur and hair are not naturally these colors; as is common in some upper-class circles in Mothorial, she enjoys dyeing them from time to time to reflect moods, seasons, and current fashion. She picked up this practice from her mother, who brought it from her own background. They're the only two hewani in Mosswood who indulge in the practice. Ava tried it once and dyed her own hair green, much to Ackerley's horror.
