<h2>Author's Notes</h2>

As a gecko-bearded dragon, Vex is a relatively uncommon example of a species mix. In general, when two hewani have a child, that child ends up displaying only the characteristics of one of the two. While Ava, Cori, and Raiona are all monospecies, Ackerley, as a goose-pheasant, is another example of a mix.
