<h2>Author's Notes</h2>

In the past, many small towns in Mothorial tended to house certain species depending on their climate, such as Polar Bears to the north in Icescape, or prairie dogs in the High Lands and Dust Edge. In recent years, however, there has been a shift as more families have spread out with more convenient transportation routes. Ava, Cori, and Raiona all originally come from out of town, while Vex's family have lived in Mosswood for many years.

AVA: Do we have to do this right now?<br>

CORIANDER: They just want to <i>talk,</i> Ava.<br>

AVA: If Vex wants to say something, let <i>them.</i><br>

VEX: She's right, Coriander. This is between me and <b><i>Brave-a.</b></i><br>

AVA: Don't call me that.<br>

VEX: Why? You used to <i>love</i> it.<br>

AVA: I'm not doing this.<br>

VEX: What, too tired from chasing burlers around with your <i>papa?</i><br>

AVA: He's not my <i>dad,</i> Vex.<br>

VEX: Come on, Ave. I'm just messing, chill. Like Cori said, I just want to talk.
