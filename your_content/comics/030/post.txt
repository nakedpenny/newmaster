<h2>Author's Notes</h2>

It's really important to me that the dialogue in Mothorial flows as naturally as possible. This can be a challenge with space limitations, but it also presents a fun opportunity to learn how to balance effective dialogue with efficient storytelling. Some pages end up having as much as 25% to 30% of their dialogue cut and combined and tweaked to fit the space, then rewritten a third time to flow properly. Webcomics, amiright?
