<h2>Author's Notes</h2>

You may have noticed a little glow around Vex's small pouch. It's a bag of holding, and one of Vex's most prized possessions. Where did they get it? That's a story for another page.

<h2>Transcript</h2>

RAIONA: Guess I'll see you later, then...?<br>

CORI: Guess so.<br>

VEX: Does Rai know there's a creature running around out there?<br>

CORI: Of course not. <b><i>I</b></i> didn't tell her.<br>

CORI: It's probably just a loose buoro or something.<br>

VEX: Whatever it is, you're <i>sure</i> it won't hurt Ava?<br>

CORI: Nah, we're just giving her a good scare.<br>

CORI: After what she did to you...<br>

CORI: ...It's only fair, right?<br>

VEX: Yeah, she deserves it.
