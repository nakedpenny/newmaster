<h2>Author's Notes</h2>

Feyn are a bit more aware of what's going on than animals in our world. Feyn researchers are still studying the varying levels of mental capacity of these creatures, but some, such as burlers and giabos, seem to have some degree of intelligence, while others are more in line with what we would consider typical of animals. Some researchers think there may be a correlation between the ability to access and use magic, as all hewani have, and this degree of self-awareness, but this is still no more than a vague theory.
