<h2>Author's Notes</h2>

One thing you learn (or try to learn) as you write for a comic is how to make dialogue flow and fit in a page while still allowing the art to shine! Sometimes, out of necessity, you end up with text-heavy pages like this one, and you turn to close-ups to help the art continue to stand out. Of course, when you're focusing on a lot of close-ups, you want to keep the visuals looking dynamic, which I think Izzy has done a marvelous job of here.

ACKERLEY: Hey, he froze for a moment. It kind of worked.<br>

AVA: He was just confused.<br>

AVA: This thing is <b><i>useless.</b></i><br>

ACKERLEY: You don't need it! You can figure it out your way.<br>

AVA: That <b><i>was</b></i> my way.<br>

ACKERLEY: No, think it over. We can't catch it by running, especially not an old <b><i>codger</b></i> like me.<br>

AVA: Ackerley, you're 35.<br>

ACKERLEY: Well, I don't think even <b><i>you</b></i> could outrun it.<br>

ACKERLEY: So what should we do?<br>

AVA: I've got it!<br>

ACKERLEY: ...What are you thinking? A net? Maybe bait?<br>

AVA: Stay here, and get ready.<br>

ACKERLEY: Get ready for wh-<br>

ACKERLEY: Um...Ava?<br>

ACKERLEY: ...oh, dear.
