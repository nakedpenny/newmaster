<h2>Author's Notes</h2>

This library is full of happy memories for Ava. But it houses some darker ones, too.

ACKERLEY: How many times have I told you what's out there?
CORT: Afternoon...
AVA: I can handle myself!
ACKERLEY: You could get <i>hurt,</i> Ava!
AVA: Why do you always treat me like a kit?
AVA: Just 'cause <i>you're</i> scared all the time doesn't mean <i><b>I</b></i> have to be!
AVA: Stop acting like you're my <i><b>dad!</b></i>
ACKERLEY: You want me to treat you like an adult? Then <i><b>act</i></b> like one for once!
ACKERLEY: What would you do if something went <i><b>wrong?</b></i>
AVA: ...I-I'd think of something.
