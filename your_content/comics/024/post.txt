<h2>Author's Notes</h2>

When it comes to character design, it's important to consider their silhouette! Often at least one defined visual feature can really help bring a character to life. That's why Mickey Mouse's ears are always drawn next to one another regardless on where he is facing; those two circles are what make his silhouette so iconic. In designing Ava, Izzy gave similar consideration to her silhouette, which resulted in her long strand of fur that sticks out in front of her face. Not only does it make it easier to identify her, but it's also great for expressing how she's feeling in a fun visual way!

AVA: Ackerley says the <b><i>same thing!</b></i><br>

AVA: I'm not a kit, Gabby.<br>

GABBY: Never said you were.<br>

GABBY: Next to me, pretty much <b><i>anyone</i></b> who can still run around without their knees popping is a youngin'.<br>

GABBY: It's not that you're not a <b><i>capable</b></i> lass. I doubt there's a braver soul in Mosswood.<br>

GABBY: But bravery without caution is like ale without a mug.<br>

GABBY: If you don't have something to hold it in, you'll end up with a <b><i>mess</b></i> on your hands.<br>

GABBY: I know I'm here to dispense <b><i>drinks,</b></i> not wisdom, but sometimes I enjoy giving a shot of both.<br>

GABBY: If you'll humor me, of course.<br>

AVA: I'll drink to that.
