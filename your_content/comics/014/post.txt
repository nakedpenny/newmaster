<h2>Author's Notes</h2>

The burler is one of many creatures we designed for the world of Mothorial! They were inspired by moles and raccoons, and are seen as more of a pest than an actual threat. Some hewani even keep them as pets, though they can be a bit feisty and difficult to train.

AVA: <b><i>I SEE IT!</b></i><br>

ACKERLEY: <b><i>You scared it off!</b></i><br>

AVA: Come on, Ackerley! You think we can't keep up with it? Maybe this job's too <b><i>intense</b></i> for you.<br>

ACKERLEY: Ah, but don't forget - it's not a <b><i>job,</b></i> Ava. It's a <i>quest!</i><br>

AVA: Sorry, a quest.<br>

ACKERLEY: <i>Yes, <b>Ava,</b></i> a <i>quest!</i><br>

ACKERLEY:The Lady Gretchen has sent us out into her <i>ancient</i> field of wheat to make battle with the <b><i>ferocious burler</b></i> that has been eating her kingdom's crops.<br>

ACKERLEY: If we're victorious, we will be rewarded with one of her renowned <i>swiftberry pies.</i><br>

AVA: <b><i>That's</b></i> the story we're going with? I don't think the words "ferocious" and "burler" have <b><i>ever</b></i> appeared in the same sentence.<br>

ACKERLEY: I'm working with what I've got. Let's see <b><i>you</b></i> do better.
