<h2>Author's Notes</h2>

As an artist/writer duo, Izzy and I work hard to ensure that we can fit a good amount of text on each page while still giving the art a chance to shine. This process involves writing the script, creating thumbnails, taking a second pass of the script, sketching the page, doing a third pass of the script, and finally creating the speech bubbles with the final art. I'll be writing a more in depth breakdown as a Writer's Blog on the Patreon!

GABBY: The <b><i>Grey Pines</b></i> are no place for a youngin'.
